# Data

TBC

## Known issues

- Data has been restructured for ease of use; some of the examples might follow legacy directory structure, but code works with new directory structure
- Processed data doesn't exist yet for training data since it's not a priority for evaluation. However, will be rolled out shortly.
- The following images in the dataset are known to have been corrupted:

    ```{bash}
    raw_captures/training_data/images/0060000813_a/i0.png
    ```
